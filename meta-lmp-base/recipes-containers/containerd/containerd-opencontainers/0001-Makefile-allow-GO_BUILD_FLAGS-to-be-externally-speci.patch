Subject: [PATCH] Makefile: allow GO_BUILD_FLAGS to be externally specified

Since our oe-core go infrastructure insists on both -pie and static
builds (for the most part), and that is not recommended by many
packages, we end up with errors like:

  cannot find package runtime/cgo (using -importcfg)
          ...
         recipe-sysroot-native/usr/lib/aarch64-poky-linux/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/link:
         cannot open file : open : no such file or directory

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [specific to OE go configuration and build]
