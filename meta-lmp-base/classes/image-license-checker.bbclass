# Purpose
# -------
# The image-license-checker class is for:
# * Preventing packages with blacklisted licenses from being used in a rootfs.
# * Preventing recipes with blacklisted licenses from contributing files to the
#   non-rootfs part of an image.
#
# Unlike the INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE mechanism, this class works at a rootfs/image
# level rather than a package level. With this class you can allow blacklisted
# licensed packages to be built, but prevent them from being included in images
# whose recipes inherit from this class.
#
# Also unlike the INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE mechanism, this class doesn't take into
# account ORs ("|"s) in license expressions. The INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE mechanism
# will only prevent a package "package1" with license "lic1 | lic2" to be built
# when both lic1 and lic2 are blacklisted. That approach doesn't work because a
# dependent package "package2" might be using "package1" under the terms of a
# blacklisted license even if "package1" is also available under a different
# non-blacklisted license.
#
# Usage
# -----
# To use this class in a recipe for an image:
# * If you want to blacklist licenses in the rootfs, set
#   IMAGE_LICENSE_CHECKER_ROOTFS_BLACKLIST to a space delimited list of SPDX
#   license names to be blacklisted from the rootfs.
# * If you want to blacklist licenses in the non-rootfs parts of an image, set
#   IMAGE_LICENSE_CHECKER_NON_ROOTFS_BLACKLIST to a space delimited list of SPDX
#   license names to be blacklisted from the non-rootfs parts of the image.
# * Add the line "inherit image-license-checker".
#
# Example
# -------
# IMAGE_LICENSE_CHECKER_ROOTFS_BLACKLIST = "GPL-3.0 LGPL-3.0 AGPL-3.0"
# IMAGE_LICENSE_CHECKER_NON_ROOTFS_BLACKLIST = "GPL-3.0 LGPL-3.0 AGPL-3.0"
# inherit image-license-checker
