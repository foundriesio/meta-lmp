SUMMARY = "Linux container runtime"
DESCRIPTION = "Linux container runtime \
 Docker complements kernel namespacing with a high-level API which \
 operates at the process level. It runs unix processes with strong \
 guarantees of isolation and repeatability across servers. \
 . \
 Docker is a great building block for automating distributed systems: \
 large-scale web deployments, database clusters, continuous deployment \
 systems, private PaaS, service-oriented architectures, etc. \
 . \
 This package contains the daemon and client, which are \
 officially supported on x86_64 and arm hosts. \
 Other architectures are considered experimental. \
 . \
 Also, note that kernel version 3.10 or above is required for proper \
 operation of the daemon process, and that any lower versions may have \
 subtle and/or glaring issues. \
